# The TensorFlow Playground

Considering the number of deep learning libraries that are available, TensorFlow is hard to ignore. Coming from a Java background, I was most interested in Deeplearning4j. However, TensorFlow has a tremendous amount of backing and support, so, here's my playground of ideas and intellectual soup.
